        <p>MemeIt was born as a Coding-Academy sprint task, on the black october of 2020. It was made with blood, sweat
            and tears, just as we like it!
            What started as a confusing nightmare of a complete blackout, with the thought of <br>"I REALLY DONT KNOW
            JAVASCRIPT I FORGOT ALSO CSS AHAHAHAH WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE", turned out to be even worse nightmare.
            <span class="bold-p">but we always kept a smile on our face!</span>
            we (by we i mean I) hope you'd like the result! we (i) did our best, and, well, it is what it is, and that's
            ok!
